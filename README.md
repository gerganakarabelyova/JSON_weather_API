# JSON weather API exercise project

🥶 This project is about using a Web API from OpenWeatherMap.org to request a JSON file with the current weather data of a certain city. Parts of this data are then displayed using different icons (emojis). 

🥵 The project was created with the idea to exercise the usage of JSON files, so don't be too hard on the design of the website :) I simply had no time to spend on it, functionality was more important.

☀️ The website that uses the weather API is the html file. The JSON file is full of example JSON data from the current date when the project was created, for the city of London, UK. It's just an example. That data changes all the time, depending on the current weather forecast and the city you choose.
