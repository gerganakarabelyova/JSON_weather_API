# JSON weather API exercise project

This project is about using a Web API from OpenWeatherMap.org to request a JSON file with the current weather data of a certain city. Parts of this data are then displayed using different icons (emojis). 

The project was created with the idea to exercise the usage of JSON files, so don't be too hard on the design of the website :) I simply had no time to spend on it, functionality was more important.
